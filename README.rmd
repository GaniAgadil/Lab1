##Link RStudio and git

##Build a book

* Deliverable (1): what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work, but please answer the next one and see the next page.

First I did not have package bookdown and could not knit it. 
Again tried it after installing the bookdown package and again I did not have another package.

* Deliverable (2): Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, and how you managed to solve it.

In my view, needing to install many packages during the knitting stage was annoying. 
It is better to know the list of packages that we need befor knitting.

##Deal with the weather (stations) ...



##... and some funny file formats

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
download.file('ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz', "C:/Users/Zara/Desktop/stat585/z.gz", method = "auto", quiet=FALSE)
#install.packages('R.utils')
library(R.utils)
gunzip("C:/Users/Zara/Desktop/stat585/z.gz")
```
